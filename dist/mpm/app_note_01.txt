Applicable Products and Version Numbers: CP/NET V1.2

Use a small patch to the SERVER.RSP module to write a NETWRKIF module that has
marked space and performance efficiencies.

The patch causes all of the SERVER processes to write their output to the same
queue, NtwrkQ00:

0A>pip server.sav=server.rsp
0A>ddt server.rsp
[MP/M II] DDT VERS 2.0
NEXT PC
0D00 0100
-A0543
0543 mvi a,30
0545 jmp 34F
0548 .
-Iserver.rsp
-W18
-G0
0A>

The patched SERVER.RSP must now be GENSYSed into MP/M-II.

With this patch installed, a server architecture is possible that requires
only 2 non-reentrant NETWRKIF processes: one queue to the output NETWRKIF
process, and one input queue for every server process on the host computer.
The relationship between queues and processes is shown in the following
figure.

Figure 1. Server architecture

The process NTWRKIN handles all network input and routes messages from the
network interface to the appropriate server process through an input queue.
The process NTWRKOUT reads the single output queue and sends a response
message back out over the network.

Minimizing the number of Process Descriptors (PD) and queues improves MP/M-II
dispatch time, because the process and queue threads are shorter and take less
time to traverse. Less common memory is required, because fewer Process
Descriptors and Queue Control Block (QCB) are needed.

Enough buffer space must be allocated to the output queue, so that a pointer
to a message from every server process in the system can be written
simultaneously, or the NETWRKIF module can limit the number of messages being
worked on at any one time, and size the queue buffer accordingly. This process
involves a small amount of buffer management analogous to the MX queue
demonstrated in Appendix E of the "CP/NET Network Operating System Reference
Manual".

This type of server architecture is demonstrate by the example programs in
Appendices F and G.
