Applicable Products and Version Numbers: CP/NET V1.2

Function 12, Return Version Number, returns a 2-byte value in register HL. The
low-order byte contains the release number. This number is set to 22
hexadecimal if CP/NET is running under CP/M Version 2.2. The high-order byte
specifies the operating system type: 0=CP/M, 1=MP/M-II, and 2=CP/NET or
CP/NOS.

Many application programs specifically check to ensure that they are running
under either CP/M or MP/M-II. They might fail when run under CP/NET or CP/NOS.
Another problem arises when applications check the release number before
performing certain shared file operations. For example, CB-80 requires a
hexadecimal 30 or greater in the release number before opening a file in
shared mode.

The following patch causes Function 12 to return any desired version number
when the NDOS has been loaded for CP/NET operations.

A>ren ndos.sav=ndos.spr
A>ddt ndos.spr

-G0
A>save 15 ndos.spr

where (version number) is an hexadecimal value, chosen to support a desired
application:

0022 makes the system look like unmodified CP/M 2.2
0130 makes the system look like MP/M-II
0230 CP/NET, but with a version number that allows
CB-80 to run using shared files.

This same patch can be applied to CP/NOS. Link CP/NOS as you would to produce
a COM file. The patch is made to the COM file before converting it to ROM, or
to a form that you can download.

The size of the COM file depends on the size of your CPNIOS and CPBIOS
modules. Save the correct number of pages after performing the patch.

Because this patch makes the CP/NET or CP/NOS system have the same version
number as a CP/M system, applications that specifically check for a CP/NET
system might now function improperly. Applications that require the system to
look like MP/M-II might not work when the system is configured to look like
CP/M. All CP/NET utilities check to make sure that the operating system type
is set to 2, for CP/NET. It might be useful to write a set of programs that
dynamically perform the patching process. This allows a user to invoke the
appropriate version number before running an application.

When running either CP/NET or CP/NOS with a version number of 30 or greater,
make sure that the application makes no calls to MP/M-II or CP/M Plus
functions not supported by CP/NET. Examples of such functions are queue
handling calls, attach and detach functions, multisector I/O, and memory
management. Invoking such functions results in a program error.
