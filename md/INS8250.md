### Description:

This HBA target implements a serial transport over an INS8250
serial port, which should be software compatible with the 16C550,
16C2550, and others in the family.
The default code is configured for the "LP" serial port on
a Heathkit H8/H89 (address 0E0H), using a 1.8432 MHz data clock.
For most cases, the changes for different systems are
limited to SERPORT (base port address) and
SERBAUD (divisor latch value for desired BAUD).

### Building

make NIC=ser-dri HBA=ins8250

### Using

Use with CpnetSerialServer.jar with the **cpnet_protocol** property
(or **proto=** commandline option) set to **DRI**.
