### Description

The [mt011](https://github.com/markt4311/MT011)
is an [RC2014](http://www.rc2014.co.uk/) compaitible
ethernet controller based on the
[w5500](https://www.wiznet.io/product-item/w5500/) wiznet chip
with a [Featherwing](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-wiz5500-wiznet-ethernet-featherwing) breakout board.

This board was developed by Mark T with input from Jay Cotton.  

### Building

 make NIC=w5500 HBA=mt011

### Using

To run this board with CP/NET there are a few things that are needed.
A ROM/RAM board with [RomWBW](https://github.com/wwarthen/RomWBW) v3.0.1 or newer.
The MT011 board.

The MT011 does not reset the W5500 during system RESET,
so it retains settings during system RESET-reboot.
The W5500 may be reset by software, when required.

##On your CP/M console:
###CP/M 2.2
```
b:pip a:=c:ccp.spr  (assumes your cpnet code is installed on the c drive)
c:ifconfig -s (https://github.com/jayacotton/inettools-z80)  (this command gets a DHCP address for the wiznet board)
c:wizcfg 0 0 <host ip address> 31100 45
c:cpnetldr  (this loads the cpnet bios code )
c:network k:=c:[0]  (k on my machine, YMMV)
```
###CP/M 3.0
```
c:ifconfig
c:wizcfg 0 0 <host ip address> 31100 45
c:network k:=c:[0]
```

##Caveat's

The above assumes you have a server running on a host machine somewhere.
See cpnet-z80/doc/CpnetSocketServer.pdf for information on running the 
server.
