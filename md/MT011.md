### Description

The [mt011](https://github.com/markt4311/MT011)
is an [RC2014](http://www.rc2014.co.uk/) compaitible
ethernet controller based on the
[w5500](https://www.wiznet.io/product-item/w5500/) wiznet chip
with a [Featherwing](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-wiz5500-wiznet-ethernet-featherwing) breakout board.

This board was developed by Mark T with input from Jay Cotton.  

It is highly recommended to use the 
[Adafruit FRAM breakout board](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1897)
with this software, as it allows storing the CP/NET and WixNET configuration in
non-volatile RAM and avoids the need to initialize the WizNET after a power on.
This board is interfaced to the second SPI port, on the upper-left of the MT011.
The FRAM board pinout does not match the MT011 SPI port pinout, so an adapter board
(wiring) is required. The utility WIZCFG.COM may be used to store configuration in
the FRAM.

To build without the FRAM, you must modify src/mt011/config.lib
and change the NVRAM variable to "0".

### Building

 make NIC=w5500 HBA=mt011

### Using

To run this board with CP/NET there are a few things that are needed.
A ROM/RAM board with [RomWBW](https://github.com/wwarthen/RomWBW) v3.0.1 or newer.
The MT011 board.

The MT011 does not reset the W5500 during system RESET,
so it retains settings during system RESET-reboot.
The W5500 may be reset by software, when required.

##On your CP/M console:
###CP/M 2.2
```
b:pip a:=c:ccp.spr  (assumes your cpnet code is installed on the c drive)
c:ifconfig -s (https://github.com/jayacotton/inettools-z80)  (this command gets a DHCP address for the wiznet board)
c:wizcfg 0 0 <host ip address> 31100 45
c:cpnetldr  (this loads the cpnet bios code )
c:network k:=c:[0]  (k on my machine, YMMV)
```
###CP/M 3.0
```
c:ifconfig
c:wizcfg 0 0 <host ip address> 31100 45
c:network k:=c:[0]
```

##Caveat's

The above assumes you have a server running on a host machine somewhere.
See cpnet-z80/doc/CpnetSocketServer.pdf for information on running the 
server.
